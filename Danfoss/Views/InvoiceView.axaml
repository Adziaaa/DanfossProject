						heat-only boilers as well as units that combine the production of heat with the production / consumption
						of electricity (CHPs). They are planning the heat schedules manually but now theywantto cost optimize their production
						.The goal of the project is to define heat schedules for all available production units with the lowest possible

					<TextBlock FontSize="15" TextWrapping="WrapWithOverflow" Margin="20" >
						District heating is hot water from a power plant which is distributed to the buildings in a city through
					highly insulated pipes. In the buildings, the hot water is used for heating and for domestic hot water. 
					The cooled water is then sent back to the plant, where it is reheated again.Figure 1 shows a small district
					heating grid with two heat producers.Classified as BusinessThe majority of the heat comes from cogeneration plants that produce both electricity 
						and heat. The heat can be produced in many different ways and with different types of fuel, such as waste,
						gas, coal, and biomass. In addition, the industry's surplus heat, solar and geothermal heat,and large heat
						pumps as well as electric boilers are also used.Figure 2 shows how heat production and electricity production 
						/ consumption is connected to the heat consumers.
